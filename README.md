This project is an implementaion to a story with requirements for building a system for park management.
The story was givenn as a mission from college.

The system is with client server architecture.

some of the functions are ordering a visitation in the park, cancel visit, add to waiting list, send reminder messages day before visit.
there are also functions for employees which need to identify like making reports, updates of park parameters, park entrance simulation, register of subsribers and guides.

pricing are calculated different for each type of visitor and the mangers of each park can add an extra discount.
